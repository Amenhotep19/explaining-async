# Explaining Async/Await

> This package requires at least **Node v10**

This is the code for [my talk on async/await](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7Y0nR1rIchCRgp).

In order to run all the code include the async/wait, you'll need Node 7+.

Getting Started:
1. run `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Make sure you have the Current version of node installed (7+)
3. Run the js files in your console.
